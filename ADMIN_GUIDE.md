### Backend Implementation
- Django admin configuration (`/api/admin.py`)
- Model registration for Scholarship and Application
- Custom admin views with proper fieldsets
- Readonly fields for metadata

### Local Development Setup
1. **Frontend:** `cd client && npm run dev` (runs on port 3001)
2. **Backend:** `cd server/backend && source .venv/bin/activate && python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8001`
3. **Admin access:** http://localhost:8001/admin/

## Troubleshooting

### "Port already in use" Error
- Check if Django is already running: `ps aux | grep python`
- Kill existing processes or use different port
- Run: `python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8002`

### Admin Login Issues
- Verify Django server is running on port 8001
- Check superuser exists: `python manage.py createsuperuser`
- Ensure correct credentials are used

### No Data in Admin Panel
- Run migrations: `python manage.py migrate`
- Create sample data: `python manage.py create_scholarships`
- Check database connection
