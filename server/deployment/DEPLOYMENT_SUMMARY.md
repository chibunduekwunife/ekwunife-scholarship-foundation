- `deployment/deploy_production.sh` - Complete deployment script
- `deployment/check_environment.sh` - Environment verification

### Documentation  
- `deployment/PRODUCTION_SETUP.md` - Detailed setup guide
- `deployment/QUICK_START.md` - Quick reference commands

## ðŸš€ Production Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Upload Files
Upload your Django project with the new files to your production server.

### Step 2: Choose Your Method

#### Method A: Quick Setup (Recommended)
```bash
# On your production server
cd /path/to/your/django/project/server/backend
python manage.py create_scholarships
```

#### Method B: Complete Deployment
```bash
# On your production server
cd /path/to/your/django/project/server/backend
./deployment/deploy_production.sh
```

#### Method C: Using Fixtures
```bash
# On your production server
cd /path/to/your/django/project/server/backend
python manage.py loaddata api/fixtures/scholarships.json
```

### Step 3: Verify Setup
```bash
# Check if scholarships were created
python manage.py verify_scholarships

# Test API endpoint
curl https://your-domain.com/api/scholarships/
```

## ðŸ“‹ Expected Production Results

After successful deployment, you should have:

1. **Database**: 2 scholarships created
   - "Secondary School Scholars SSCE" 
   - "Best Graduating University Students"

2. **API**: Working endpoint at `/api/scholarships/`

3. **Frontend**: Scholarship dropdown populated with real data

4. **Applications**: Can be submitted with correct scholarship IDs

## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting

### If scholarships aren't showing in frontend:
1. Check API endpoint: `curl https://your-domain.com/api/scholarships/`
2. Verify scholarships in database: `python manage.py verify_scholarships`
3. Check Django logs for API errors
4. Ensure CORS is configured for frontend requests

### If API returns empty:
1. Run: `python manage.py create_scholarships`
2. Check database connection
3. Verify migrations are applied: `python manage.py migrate`

### If deployment fails:
1. Run environment check: `./deployment/check_environment.sh`
2. Check permissions: `chmod +x deployment/*.sh`
3. Verify Django settings for production

## ðŸŽ¯ Next Steps

1. **Deploy to Production**: Use one of the methods above
2. **Test Frontend**: Verify scholarship dropdown works
3. **Test Applications**: Submit a test application
4. **Monitor**: Check logs for any issues
